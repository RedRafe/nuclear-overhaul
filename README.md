# NUCLEAR OVERHAUL
This mod reshapes the processing steps of Uranium in Factorio and adds new elements of the periodic table as byproducts which can be further reprocessed into more advanced recipes. The goal is to achieve a more realistic nuclear behavior by adding a new level of complexity to the game and new production lines to explore.

### Main features
1. Uranium process revisited (more complex & realistic)
   1. Drills no longer require sulfuric acid to mine Uranium ore, but it will be used later in chemical facilities to obtain Yellowcake
   1. Uranium ore yields 20% of U-235/U-238 like real one
2. New elements of the periodic table!
   2. [90]Thorium, [91] Protactinium, [92] Uranium, [93] Neptunium, [94] Plutonium
   2. Decay recipes
3. Nuclear Reactors revisited
   3. Reactors now come in 3 tiers: LWR, HPWR, LFTR. Advance through technologies!
   3. No neighbors bonus! You'll know why... ;)
   3. Watch out! Reactors are a great source of energy, but a what cost?

### Known Bugs & Mod compatibility
Please feel free to report any known issue! :) 
This nuclear overhaul mod introduces heavy changes in the Uranium process, expect it to break other mods that deal with Uranium too! (should not interfere with other mechanics) It's still a new project, message me if you'd like compatibility with target mods and I'll try my best!

### Future developments
- [] Introduce new war items/equipments obtained by nuclear waste
- [] Reskin some arts (you can help me!)
- [] Add new elements of the periodic table
- [] Add infinite/dedicate science techs for nuclear
- [] add matter recipes for U an Th of K2
