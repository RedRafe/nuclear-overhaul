# NUCLEAR OVERHAUL
===

This mod reshapes the processing steps of Uranium in Factorio to be more complex and realistic, adds new elements of the periodic table as well as new types and mechanics of nuclear reactors. The goal is to achieve a more realistic nuclear behavior by adding new levels of complexity to the game and new production lines to explore.

## Main features
The mod introduces 12 new technologies, 19 new items, and 20 new recipes, that are designed to give nuclear processes a bit of realism as well as making it a fun production line to design and a relevant aspect of your factory. 

### 1. Uranium process revisited (more complex & realistic) 
   - Drills no longer require sulfuric acid to mine Uranium ore, but it will be used later in chemical facilities to obtain Yellowcake from uranium ore
   - Uranium ore yields 20% of U-235/U-238, just like IRL

### 2. New elements of the periodic table!
   - *[90]* Thorium, *[91]* Protactinium, *[92]* Uranium's isotopes, *[93]* Neptunium, *[94]* Plutonium
   - Alpha & Beta decay recipes

### 3. Nuclear Reactors revisited
   - Reactors now come in 3 tiers: **LWR**, **HPWR**, **LFTR**. Advance through technologies!
   - New nuclear design mechanic: NO neighbors bonus! You'll get know why... ;)
   - Watch out! Reactors are a great source of energy, but a what cost?

## Known Bugs & Mod compatibility
Please feel free to report any known issue! :) 
This nuclear overhaul mod introduces heavy changes in the Uranium process, expect it to break other mods that deal with Uranium too! (should not interfere with other mechanics tho). It's still a new project, message me if you'd like compatibility with target mods and I'll try my best! For any inquiries, please refer to the discussion page of the mod portal.

## Future developments
- [ ] Introduce new war items/equipments obtained by nuclear waste
- [ ] Re-skin some arts (you can help me!)
- [ ] Add further elements of the periodic table
- [ ] Add infinite/dedicate science techs requiring nuclear
- [x] add matter recipes for U an Th of K2
