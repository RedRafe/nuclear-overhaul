[entity-description]
  lw-reactor=LWR - Light Water Reactor use thermal neutrons to generate power. Thermal reactors are slower and generate more nuclear waste
  phw-reactor=PHWR - Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor are smaller but can burn all actinides during the nuclear reaction and generate more power.
  lft-reactor=LFTR - Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor - are more efficient, powerful and safer to operate compared to LWRs or PHWRs. They require a bit of Uranium to get started but consume mostly Thorium.

  update-interval=Seconds between reactor updates (s)
  day-length=Length of the day (ticks)

[mod-setting-description]
  update-interval=Seconds between reactor updates, default is 60 (1 min). Higher value will result in bulk reactor updates while lower value will better randomize reactors triggers.
  day-length=Length of the day (ticks), default is 25000. This value will affect the frequency of events: lower value -> more frequent, higher value -> less frequent
